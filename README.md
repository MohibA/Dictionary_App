# Dictionary_App

In this project I am going to implement a linguistic application that uses a pronunciation dictionary for finding words with similar pronunciation.

we will get the user input, go through the dictionary "cmudict.0.7a" and get the pronunciation of the word the user has inputed, get the identical word, add phoneme, replace phoneme and remove phoneme to find words. In addition, we will ignore all words that contain non-alphabet characters and alternative pronunciations
